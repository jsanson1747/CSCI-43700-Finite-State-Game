## Game Premise:
**Backstory:** Its the year 4000. Humanity has spiraled into a worldwide dystopia. Technology is beyond advanced but society is crumbling. You play as an unnamed character who has woken up in a strange complex not remembering who they are or how they got there. In this text based adventure, you must find clues to find your way out of this mysterious complex and see what world awaits you beyond its walls. 

## Technologies Used:
The game is developed using Object Oriented Programming. It is written in Java and was prototyped using Twine.Prototyping in Twine helped to organize the relationships between each of the different nodes.

## Program Structure
Since this game takes the structure of a Finite State Machine, it's important to establish a structure for how each node is related.

Also due to the fact that I programmed this game in Java, it is important to have a solid plan for how each Java class interacts.
